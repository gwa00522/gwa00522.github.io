<p style="font-family: times new roman">
  College football is one of the most exciting sports in all of the world. The fans are loyal, the traditions are excellent, and the games are always exciting. Among many traditionally dominant programs, UGA is one of the few that stand alone on the pedestal. They have produced countless great teams, all-americans, NFL players, and great coaches. Names such as Todd Gurley, Champ Bailey, AJ Green, and Herschel Walker ring bells in the ears of all football fans. Out of all of the many great season UGA football has had, the 1980 season is the greatest ever. This was Herschel Walker's freshman season, and not only was he the best player in the SEC, he was also the most dominant player in the country. Walker led Georgia to a 12-0 record and their second ever national title.
  It is difficult to narrow down all of the greatest UGA football players into one list, but I am going to attempt to do just that on this webpage. Some factors taken into account when determing the "greatness" of the player are their stats, accomplishments as a player, and NFL careers. There are a very large amount of players that have met this criteria, and I will breaking them down into a top-ten list.

<h3>Top Ten UGA football Players</h3>
  <ol>
<li>Herschel Walker</li>
  <li>Frank Sinkwich</li>
  <li>Charley Trippi</li>
  <li>Champ Bailey</li>
  <li>Hines Ward</li>
  <li>Roquan Smith</li>
  <li>Garrison Hearst</li>
  <li>Todd Gurley</li>
  <li>Matthew Stafford</li>
  <li>David Pollack</li>
  </ol>
 <p>
 <p style="font-family:times new roman">
 The names in this list could honesly be put in any order, with the exception of Herschel Walker at the number 1 spot. He is undoubetly the greatest player to ever play at UGA, won the heisman in 1982, was a 3-time all-american, and broke countless records. He was truly unstoppable. Two other names I didn't mention are AJ Green and Knoshon Moreno. Both saw success at the next level and were also outstanding players for the Bulldogs as well. With so many great players, UGA is without a doubt one of the greatest college football programs ever.
